# MobileSync Backups Symlink to External Drive
# By default, macOS doesn't allow you change the location of the backups created for mobile devices, i.e., /Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup
# To resolve this, a symlink is created. Warning: not tested with "moved" backups.
# Disabled by default, run manually if needed.
