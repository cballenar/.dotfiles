# Piantor Keyboard Configuration

These are Vial backup files of the keyboard configuration.

- v1 - Initial configuration. Very close to the default Piantor setup.
- v2 - Added a few more layers and macros, testing custom tap dance functions.
- v3 - Reverts back to Mod-Tap due to better functioning and easier management. Rearranges keys and adds All Mod combos.
- v4 - Changes to home row mods setup. Changes media to layer 3 and makes available to both hands. Cleans up old configuration.
